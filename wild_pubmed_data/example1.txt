Background: Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are subjected to stress, including sound of high intensity.
Background: The sound environment in the NICU is louder than most home or office environments and contains disturbing noises of short duration and at irregular intervals. There are competing auditory signals that frequently challenge preterm infants, staff and parents. 
Background: The sound levels in NICUs often exceed the maximum acceptable level of @ decibels (dB), recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Background: Hearing impairment is diagnosed in @% to @% of preterm infants versus @% of the general paediatric population.
Background: Noise may cause apnoea, hypoxaemia, alternation in oxygen saturation, and increased oxygen consumption secondary to elevated heart and respiratory rates and may, therefore, decrease the amount of calories available for growth. 
Background: Elevated levels of speech are needed to overcome the noisy environment in the NICU, thereby increasing the negative impacts on staff, newborns, and their families. 
Background: High noise levels are associated with an increased rate of errors and accidents, leading to decreased performance among staff. 
Background: The aim of interventions included in this review is to reduce sound levels to @ dB or less. This can be achieved by lowering the sound levels in an entire unit, treating the infant in a section of a NICU, in a 'private' room, or in incubators in which the sound levels are controlled, or reducing the sound levels that reaches the individual infant by using earmuffs or earplugs. 
Background: By lowering the sound levels that reach the neonate, the resulting stress on the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and endocrine systems can be diminished, thereby promoting growth and reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.
Objective: Primary objective To determine the effects of sound reduction on growth and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of neonates. 
Objective: @. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on short-term medical outcomes (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity). 
Objective: @. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on sleep patterns at three months of age. 
Objective: @. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction on staff performance. 
Objective: @. To evaluate the effects of sound reduction in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on parents' satisfaction with the care.
Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, abstracts from scientific meetings, clinical trials registries (clinicaltrials.gov; controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp), Pediatric Academic Societies Annual meetings @ to @ (Abstracts2ViewTM), reference lists of identified trials, and reviews to November @.
Methods: Preterm infants (< @ weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or < @ g birth weight) cared for in the resuscitation area, during transport, or once admitted to a NICU or a stepdown unit.
Methods: We performed data collection and analyses according to the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.
Results: One small, high quality study assessing the effects of silicone earplugs versus no earplugs qualified for inclusion. 
Results: The original inclusion criteria in our protocol stipulated an age of < @ hours at the time of initiating sound reduction. 
Results: We made a deviation from our protocol and included this study in which some infants would have been > @ hours old. 
Results: There was no significant difference in weight at @ weeks postmenstrual age (PMA): mean difference (MD) @ g (@% confidence interval (CI) -@ to @ g) (n = @). There was no significant difference in weight at @ to @ months corrected age between the groups: MD 0.@ kg, @% CI -@ to @ kg (n = @). 
Results: There was a significant difference in Mental Developmental Index (Bayley II) favouring the silicone earplugs group at @ to @ months corrected age: MD @, @% CI @ to @ (n = @), but not for Psychomotor Development Index (Bayley II) at @ to @ months corrected age: MD -@, @% CI -@ to @ (n =@).
Conclusions: To date, only 34 infants have been enrolled in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of reducing sound levels that reach the infants' ears in the NICU. 
Conclusions: Based on the small sample size of this single trial, we cannot make any recommendations for clinical practice. Larger, well designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.
